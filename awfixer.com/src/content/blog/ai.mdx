# AWFixerAI

while i find the AI bubble to be extremely disagreeable and verifiably a bubble, I cannot help but say that the neural network, transformer and language model technology is really cool to study.

there are other cool things that have been built during the AI bubble (it will soon be a boom). Things like RAG are really cool. At AWFixerAI we will work on ways to use the current "AI Technology" to build cool things for a future when the bubble finally pops and we have to figure out where we are going to go next.
