├── boot/         # Boot loader files
├── dev/          # Device files
├── etc/          # Configuration files

├── tmp/          # Temporary files
├── usr/          # User programs
└── var/          # Variable data
```

## Command Line Tools

### Navigation

```bash
# Change directory
cd /path/to/directory

# Print working directory
pwd

# List files
ls -la

# AWFixer enhanced listing
awfix ls
```

### File Operations

```bash
# Copy files
cp source destination
cp -r folder/ destination/  # Recursive

# Move/rename
mv source destination

# Delete
rm file
rm -r folder/

# Create directory
mkdir new-folder

# Create nested directories
mkdir -p path/to/nested/folder
```

### Viewing Files

```bash
# View file contents
cat file.txt

# Page through large files
less file.txt

# View first/last lines
head -n 20 file.txt
tail -n 20 file.txt

# AWFixer file viewer
awfix view file.txt
```

### Searching

```bash
# Find files by name
find /path -name "*.txt"

# Find files by content
grep -r "search term" /path

# AWFixer fast search (uses index)
awfix search "filename" ~/Documents
awfix search --content "text to find" ~/
```

## File Permissions

### Understanding Permissions

```
-rwxr-xr-x  user  group  filename
│└┬┘└┬┘└┬┘
│ │  │  └── Others: read, execute
│ │  └───── Group: read, execute
│ └──────── Owner: read, write, execute
└────────── File type (- = file, d = directory)
```

### Changing Permissions

```bash
# Numeric mode
chmod 755 file    # rwxr-xr-x
chmod 644 file    # rw-r--r--

# Symbolic mode
chmod +x file     # Add execute
chmod u+w file    # Owner can write
chmod go-r file   # Remove read from group/others
```

### Changing Ownership

```bash
chown user file
chown user:group file
chown -R user:group folder/  # Recursive
```

## Compression

### Creating Archives

```bash
# Tar with gzip
tar -czf archive.tar.gz folder/

# Tar with better compression
tar -cJf archive.tar.xz folder/

# Zip format
zip -r archive.zip folder/

# AWFixer compress (auto-selects best format)
awfix compress folder/ archive
```

### Extracting Archives

```bash
# Auto-detect format
awfix extract archive.tar.gz

# Or manually
tar -xzf archive.tar.gz
unzip archive.zip
```

## Cloud Storage

AWFixerOS integrates with popular cloud services.

### Supported Services

- AWFixer Cloud (native)
- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- OneDrive
- Nextcloud

### Setup

```bash
# Add cloud account
awfix cloud add google-drive

# Mount cloud storage
awfix cloud mount google-drive ~/Cloud/GoogleDrive

# Sync folders
awfix cloud sync ~/Documents google-drive:Documents
```

## Trash and Recovery

### Using Trash

Files deleted normally go to trash:

```bash
# Delete to trash
rm file  # or press Delete in file manager

# View trash
awfix trash list

# Restore from trash
awfix trash restore filename

# Empty trash
awfix trash empty
```

### Permanent Deletion

Bypass trash for permanent deletion:

```bash
rm --permanent file
# or
shred -u file  # Secure delete
```

## Tips and Tricks

### Quick Directory Access

Create bookmarks for frequently accessed folders:

```bash
awfix bookmark add ~/Projects/work work
cd @work  # Jump to bookmark
```

### Batch Rename

Rename multiple files at once:

```bash
awfix rename "*.jpg" --pattern "{n}-photo.jpg"
# Renames: 1-photo.jpg, 2-photo.jpg, etc.
```

### Disk Usage

Check folder sizes:

```bash
# Interactive disk usage viewer
awfix disk usage ~/

# Simple summary
du -sh ~/Documents/*
```
